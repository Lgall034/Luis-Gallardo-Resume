        Enter bio here<br>Hello, my name is Luis Gallardo, I'm a public policy analyst. A little about myself I was born here in the United States, in California to be exact. My whole life I have been living here and have never moved states. I got my studies done at the University of California of Riverside, and currently work for the American Enterprise Institute, which is a non-profit organization. My job is to do different types of research in different areas of study, like poverty, education and many more. My goal is to do research to focus on real world problems and determine why they are occurring. We also look for possible outcomes that come fix and improve the issues that are occurring. For example, In a recent study me and my fellow scholar co-workers have been looking at the issue of poverty and how some school districts around the United States are failing to provide an effective way to teach students as well as missing the majority of the school year that happened during the start of COV-19. In our studies we found that areas that are located in poverty have made students less involved with school, the reason being the shut down of all schools as well as not being able to provide students the right course material and tools. What I mean by that is the technology needed to make a zoom school setting work. In areas of poverty many students donâ€™t have the privilege to have internet connection or owning a tablet or computer. Through our studies the districts have been working hard to get funds but many still canâ€™t afford leaving many students across the United states with packages of work, basically leaving themselves on their own to teach themselves or parents teaching their little students. This could of course be an issue since many parents donâ€™t have the time to teach their students and have jobs to go to. Leaving parents with another issue on their backs causing stress, and leaving them with a choice: do I continue going to work to get money for the bills or do I stop going to work and help my child and risk becoming homeless by not having income to pay for the house payment or rent. So this was an example of one of many studies that we do in which consist of more so we could provide the community and people that live in the United States to bring awareness in which the United States Government has also but trying to help many people by providing the stimulus check that have many Americans billions of dollars to support them through the hardships and rough times of the world wide pandemic that we are facing at the moment. That was a little about myself, so you guys could get an idea of what my purpose is of looking at issues that happen inside the United States as well as outside the United States like other countries especially third world countries. <br>
